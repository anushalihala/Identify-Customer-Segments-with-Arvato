In this project, Udacity's Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions provided two datasets - one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. 

The objective was to look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
